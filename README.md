DEPRECATED
Started a new homelab from scratch with a heavy focus on security, so this repo is not in use anymore. (Going with a private repo this time around)



My homelab defined through code. (WIP)


This homelab was originally made only of snowflake LXC containers, that's no good.
My goal with this project is to learn kubernetes by completely automating my homelab, which currently consists of a single NUC (more to come), an Asustor NAS and an APU2E4 running OPNsense.
