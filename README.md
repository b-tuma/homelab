My homelab defined through code. (WIP)

This homelab was originally made only of snowflake servers, that's no good.
Phase one is to automate it completely with Terraform + Ansible from scratch, just for the sake of practicing Ansible. Should be easy.

Phase two is to replace every LXC container from phase one for a single VM running Kubernetes, expand the single node to a cluster and make my dreams come true, this will take a while.
